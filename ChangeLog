        * [r73] Fix a one off buffer overrun: reported by Christian Jaeger
          http://bugs.debian.org/576244

2007-06-16  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r72] configure.ac: Update version information to 1.1

2007-06-13  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r71] NEWS: Update the NEWS file to announce the release.
	* [r70] README, privbind.1: Update the docs regarding bugs that
	  have been resolved
	* [r69] libprivbind.c: Fix bug on fcntl returning EINTR.

2007-06-12  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r67] ChangeLog, authors: Update the changelog
	* [r66] configure.ac: Update version number to 1.0
	* [r65] privbind.1: Document the "-l" flag in the man page

2007-06-08  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r64] Makefile.am, configure.ac, main.c, test.c: Add multi
	  process and multi thread tests to "test"
	  Add a configure option "--enable-testing", for internal tests in
	  privbind
	  Add optional delay after each bind inside privbind (only if
	  --enable-testing was used)

2007-06-06  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r63] libprivbind.c: Implement mutex - not tested

2007-06-06  Amos Shapira <amosshapira@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r62] ipc.h, libprivbind.c, main.c: reverted the changes to use
	  mutex (r59) and to send number of calls left (r60)
	  after Shachar mentioned the problem of the application forking
	  and calling
	  bind(2) from both processes
	* [r61] privbind.1: replace "root process" by "helper process".
	  this is the tail of such changes
	  I committed in previous checkin.
	* [r60] ipc.h, libprivbind.c, main.c: the helper process sends the
	  number of calls left together with its reply, so
	  the privbind library can cleanly avoid sending more requests
	* [r59] libprivbind.c: use a mutex to synchronize access to the
	  socket with the helper process

2007-06-05  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r58] privbind.1: Better wording of the last bug in the manual
	  Reinstate a "How it works" section which gives a short
	  description of what privbind does, and direct the user to the
	  README for more details.
	* [r57] Makefile.am: Syntactic cleanup of Makefile.am
	  Install the README file during "make install"

2007-06-05  Amos Shapira <amosshapira@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r56] privbind.1: (hopefully) improved style, redeability and
	  length of manual page
	* [r55] privbind.1: typo

2007-06-05  Nadav Har'el <nyh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r54] privbind.1: spelling

2007-06-05  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r53] bootstrap: Reorder the operations in bootstrap so that they
	  actually bootstrap
	* [r51] privbind.1: Update the "security considerations" section of
	  the man page

	  Prevent the program from closing our communication socket
	  Cleanup in auto-generation of "paths.h"

	  Moved the "how it works" section from the man page to the README

2007-06-02  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r48] ChangeLog, libprivbind.c: Cleanups of libprivbind. Improve
	  the semantic behaviour.
	* [r47] Makefile.am: Make sure that "make test" can be used with
	  different privbind and testbind parameters
	* [r46] Makefile.am, configure.ac, main.c: Add "test" target that
	  tests privbind in place.
	  Added "test-su" and "test-sudo" to automatically elevate to root
	  for the test
	* [r45] Makefile.am, test.c: Make the test file more flexible.
	* [r44] ChangeLog, main.c, test.c: Switch the order of the
	  processes. Parent now runs the command, child handles the binds
	* [r43] main.c: Code cleanup - split the parent and child code into
	  separate functions
	* [r42] ChangeLog, Makefile.am, configure.ac, main.c, test.c:
	  Better build of "test" - remove some warnings, add to makefile
	  (and to "make dist").
	  Moved the preload library from */lib to */lib/privbind to reduce
	  shared directory clutter

2007-06-01  Amos Shapira <amosshapira@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r41] main.c: removed old '-d' option passed to getopts without
	  being handled by
	  main()

2007-05-22  Amos Shapira <amosshapira@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r34] main.c: more fixes to the assumption that gid 0 is illegal.
	  I leave uid==0 alone since I'm not sure it makes sense to use
	  this program
	  and keep uid 0.
	* [r33] main.c: added missing help() function parameter type
	  fixed test for gid value legality - zero is also a legal value
	* [r32] main.c: fix typo in fixed message
	* [r31] main.c: improved help message text for -g default

2007-05-22  Shachar Shemesh <thesun@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r30] ChangeLog, Makefile.am, NEWS: Move the NEWS, which looked
	  like a changelog, to ChangeLog
	  Create a stub NEWS
	  Update Makefile.am so that make dist will work

2007-05-22  Nadav Har'el <nyh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r29] NEWS:
	* [r28] Makefile.am, privbind.1: Add manual page

2007-05-21  Nadav Har'el <nyh@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r27] main.c: Fix usage line to show that -g option is actually
	  optional, not mandatory.

	  line and other changes (see NEWS)

2007-02-16  Amos Shapira <amosshapira@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r23] branches/amos/main.c, branches/amos/test.c: switch for
	  SOCK_SEQPACKET so the parent is notified when the child closed
	  the connection.
	* [r22] branches/amos/main.c, branches/amos/test.c: some message
	  cleanup
	  send MSG_REP_NONE on MSG_REQ_NONE
	  exit(2) with the same exit value as the child
	  pay attention to the -n argument
	  TODO:
	  1. make '-g' non-mandatory - default to the user's default gid
	  from /etc/passwd
	  2. BUG - when privbind isn't root and the child exits on
	  privilege drop - the parent get blocked on recvmsg. Have to find
	  the right way to signal the parent to exit. (test: "./privbind -u
	  1000 -g 1000 -n 1 ./test" - from a regular user)

2007-02-15  Amos Shapira <amosshapira@users.sourceforge.net>

	* [r21] branches/amos/libprivbind.c, branches/amos/main.c,
	  branches/amos/test.c: now passes back the bind result.
	  practically functioning.
	* [r20] branches/amos, branches/amos/libprivbind.c,
	  branches/amos/main.c, branches/amos/test.c: test.c - added a
	  simple program which binds to TCP port 987 on local loopback
	  interface so we can test the library.
	  libprivbind.c - minor unimportant changes
	  main.c - added main loop which accepts requests from children and
	  execute them.
	  Still to complete returning of bind results in main.c
