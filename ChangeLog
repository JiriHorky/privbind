  * Move the preload library to the PKGLIBDIR.
  * Switch the functions of the fork. Parent is the "child" command, child is
    the root helper.
  * Change the libprivbind behavior:
    * Always run the local bind first, in case it works (who knows?)
    * Make sure to always return the correct errno, even if we failed on
      another reason.
  * Documentation improvements
    * Moved "How it works" from the man page to the README
    * Spelling fixes

Release 0.1 (May 21, 2007)

  * The former branch "amos" (by Amos Shapira) is now the main trunk of the
    project.
  * Cleaned up command line processing and usage messages.
  * Test program test.c now also prints the current user and group (to show that
    privbind indeed drops privileges correctly).
  * -g option now accept group name, not just group id. Note that if the -g
    option is missing, the given user's default group is used.
  * If the -n option is given, the root process (the parent) exits after these
    many binds have been performed (previously it stuck around, contrary to
    what "privbind -h" said). If the child exits prematurely (without binding
    this number of times and without leaving its end of the socket to another
    process), privbind still returns its exit code, which is useful when
    the program being run fails to run.
  * Added manual page, privbind(1)
