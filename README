Privbind is free software, released under the GNU General Public License
(see the attached file COPYING for details).


What is Privbind
================

Privbind is a tool for running a command as an unprivileged user, with
additional low port binding privileges.

Normally in Linux, only a superuser process can bind an Internet domain socket
with a reserved port (port numbers less than 1024). Accordingly, server
processes are typically run with superuser privileges, which can be dropped
after binding the reserved port. Privbind can run a server, right from the
start, under an unprivileged non-root user with just one extra privilege: the
server can bind low ports.

Privbind is useful in several situations. It can be used when the server code
cannot be trusted enough to start it as root; It can be used when the server
is written in a language without the setuid(2) feature (e.g., Java); It can
also be used to run a server written to remain running as root, while all the
privileges it really needs is the ability to bind low ports.


System requirements
===================

The current privbind implementation (see manual page privbind.1 for details)
was only tested on Linux, using a 2.6 kernel.

Among other things, it assumes the LD_PRELOAD feature, and the SOCK_SEQPACKET
socket type which is a relatively recent addition to Linux (A future release
may use the standard SOCK_STREAM type instead).


How to compile and install
==========================

The simplest way to compile and install privbind is to run

	./configure
	make
	install

please refer to the file INSTALL for more information.
