New in release 0.1 (May 21, 2007)
------------------

* The former branch "amos" (by Amos Shapira) is now the main trunk of the
  project.
* Cleaned up command line processing and usage messages.
* Test program test.c now also prints the current user and group (to show that
  privbind indeed drops privileges correctly).
* -g option now accept group name, not just group id. Note that if the -g
  option is missing, the given user's default group is used.
* If the -n option is given, the root process (the parent) exits after these
  many binds have been performed (previously it stuck around, contrary to
  what "privbind -h" said). If the child exits prematurely (without binding
  this number of times and without leaving its end of the socket to another
  process), privbind still returns its exit code, which is useful when
  the program being run fails to run.
* Added manual page, privbind(1)
